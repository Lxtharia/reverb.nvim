## Installation

By default, reverb.nvim does ship with any sounds. To get started, configure the plugin's options in your Neovim configuration. Here's an example of customizing the sounds using [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "whleucka/reverb.nvim",
  event = "BufReadPre",
  opts = {
    sounds = {
      -- add custom sound paths for other events here
      -- eg. EVENT = "/some/path/to/sound.mp3"
      BufRead = sound_dir .. "start.ogg",
      CursorMovedI =  sound_dir .. "click.ogg",
      InsertLeave = sound_dir .. "toggle.ogg",
      ExitPre = sound_dir .. "exit.ogg",
      BufWrite = sound_dir .. "save.ogg",
    },
  },
}
```
